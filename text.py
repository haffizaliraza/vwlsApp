Life is a journey, not a destination.You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.It always seems impossible until it's done.The best way to predict the future is to create it.Actions speak louder than words.Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.Life is a journey, not a destination.Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.Life is a journey, not a destination.You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.Actions speak louder than words.
